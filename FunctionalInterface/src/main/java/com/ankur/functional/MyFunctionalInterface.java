    * Functional Interface can be annotated with @FunctionalInterface annotation
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is a facility to avoid accidental addition of abstract methods in the functional interfaces
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to mark an interface as functional interface
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is a compiler level annotation
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is not mandatory to mark an interface as Functional Interface
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is a informative annotation
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is introduced in Java 8
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is a part of java.lang package
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is retained at runtime
    * @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface canâ€™t have more than one abstract method
